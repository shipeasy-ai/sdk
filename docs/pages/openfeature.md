# OpenFeature

This SDK ships **two** OpenFeature providers (CNCF OpenFeature parity) so apps
standardized on the OpenFeature API can plug Shipeasy in as the backing
provider. Both are pure adapters over `Engine` — no change to evaluation.

| Entrypoint | Pair with | Peer dep (optional) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@shipeasy/sdk/openfeature-server` | `@openfeature/server-sdk` | `@openfeature/server-sdk` |
| `@shipeasy/sdk/openfeature-web` | `@openfeature/web-sdk` | `@openfeature/web-sdk` |

The provider class is named `ShipeasyProvider` in both modules.

## Server provider

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/server-sdk";
import { Engine } from "@shipeasy/sdk/server";
import { ShipeasyProvider } from "@shipeasy/sdk/openfeature-server";

const client = new Engine({ apiKey: process.env.SHIPEASY_SERVER_KEY! });
await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(new ShipeasyProvider(client));

const ofClient = OpenFeature.getClient();
const on = await ofClient.getBooleanValue("new_checkout", false, { targetingKey: "u1" });
```

The provider's `initialize()` calls `client.initOnce()` (the SDK fires `Ready`
when the rules blob resolves) and `onClose()` calls `client.destroy()`.

## Web provider

```ts
import { OpenFeature } from "@openfeature/web-sdk";
import { Engine } from "@shipeasy/sdk/client";
import { ShipeasyProvider } from "@shipeasy/sdk/openfeature-web";

const client = new Engine({ sdkKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHIPEASY_CLIENT_KEY! });
await OpenFeature.setContext({ targetingKey: "u1", plan: "pro" });
await OpenFeature.setProviderAndWait(new ShipeasyProvider(client));

const on = OpenFeature.getClient().getBooleanValue("new_checkout", false);
```

The browser evaluates at the edge, so the web provider maps OpenFeature's static
context onto `client.identify()` (via `initialize` + `onContextChange`) and
reads the cached eval result synchronously in the resolve methods.

## Type / reason mapping

- `getBooleanValue` → `getFlagDetail` — the gate's `FlagReason` maps to an
  OpenFeature reason (`RULE_MATCH` → `TARGETING_MATCH`, `DEFAULT` → `DEFAULT`,
  `FLAG_NOT_FOUND` → `ERROR`/`FLAG_NOT_FOUND`, `CLIENT_NOT_READY` →
  `PROVIDER_NOT_READY`).
- `getStringValue` / `getNumberValue` / `getObjectValue` → `getConfig`, with a
  `TYPE_MISMATCH` error code when the stored config value doesn't match the
  requested type.

The `EvaluationContext.targetingKey` becomes the bucketing `user_id`.
