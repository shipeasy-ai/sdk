# Kill switches (`getKillswitch`)

A kill switch is an operational on/off control that ships in the same KV blob as
gates and configs. It is **not user-bound** — it answers a global "is this
killed?" question.

## Read a kill switch

```ts
import { configure, Client } from "@shipeasy/sdk/server"; // or /client

configure({ apiKey: process.env.SHIPEASY_SERVER_KEY! });
const flags = new Client(req.user);

if (flags.getKillswitch("payments")) {
  // the "payments" kill switch is KILLED — short-circuit the feature
  return showMaintenanceNotice();
}
```

`getKillswitch(name)` returns `true` when the kill switch is killed as a whole,
`false` otherwise (including for an unknown kill switch).

## Named switches

A kill switch can carry per-key override **switches**. Pass a `switchKey` to
read one specific switch:

```ts
flags.getKillswitch("checkout", "apple_pay"); // true when that switch is on
```

With a `switchKey`, the result is `true` only when that specific named switch is
on; unknown kill switches or unknown switch keys return `false`.

## Engine form

`getKillswitch` lives on the `Engine` too (same signature — it is not
user-scoped):

```ts
import { Engine } from "@shipeasy/sdk/server";
const engine = new Engine({ apiKey: process.env.SHIPEASY_SERVER_KEY! });
await engine.initOnce();
engine.getKillswitch("payments");            // whole-switch
engine.getKillswitch("checkout", "apple_pay"); // one named switch
```

## Browser facade

In the browser, the top-level facade also exposes the short alias `ks(...)`,
which is SSR-bootstrap aware (reads the hydrated bootstrap value synchronously
on first render):

```ts
import { ks } from "@shipeasy/sdk/client";
if (ks("payments")) { /* killed */ }
```
